# Case study: Bird Migration

The global positioning system, or GPS, provides location information
anywhere on earth. GPS is used for various different purposes,
ranging from commercial to military applications.
One interesting area of research uses GPS to track movements of animals. It is now possible to manufacturer a small GPS device that is solar charged, so you don't need to change batteries, and use it to track flight patterns of birds.

In this case study it will be shown how to manipulate, examine and visualize GPS data used to tracking birds. The data is referent to three diferent birds (Eric, Sanne, Nico), provided by the LifeWatch INBO project.
